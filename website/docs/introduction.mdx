I wanted to have the same experience across all the shells I use when building/validating [Oh My Posh][omp].
It's the one feature which was missing when trying to build a seamless cross shell experience for tools you use every day.

## What does it do?

It allows you to use a single, template enabled `YAML` [configuration][config] to manage the following things:

- [Alias][alias]
- [Function][alias]
- [Environment variable][env]
- [PATH entry][path]
- [Script][script]
- [Symbolic Link][link]

## I want in!

Great, all you need is to install and configure aliae on your machine and you're good to go. Find the installation guide
for your platform and have a look at the alias [configuration][config] page to get started.

[omp]: https://ohmyposh.dev
[config]: setup/configuration.mdx
[alias]: setup/alias.mdx
[env]: setup/env.mdx
[path]: setup/path.mdx
[script]: setup/script.mdx
[link]: setup/link.mdx
