## Install dependencies

### go

The codebase is in [go][go], meaning we need a working go setup before we can do anything else.
Have a look at the [go guide][go-started] to get up and running with go in no time!

:::caution
aliae needs at least go 1.21.
:::

### golangci-lint

To make sure we keep on writing quality code, [golang-ci lint][golang-ci-lint] is used to validate the changes.
Have a look at the [local installation guide][golang-ci-lint-local] to make sure you can validate this yourself as well.

## Get the source code

The source is hosted on [Github][aliae]. When you want to contribute, create a [fork][gh-fork] so you can make changes in
your repository and create a pull request in the official aliae repository.

Clone your fork of aliae locally, replace `<user>` with your Github username.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<user>/aliae.git
```

## Running tests

The go source code can be found in the `src/` directory, make sure to change to that one before continuing.

### Unit tests

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### golangci-lint

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

## Building the app

The easiest way to validate your changes is to write tests. Unfortunately, as it's a visual tool, you'll want to validate
the changes by running the prompt in your shell as well. You can make use of go's `bin` folder which is usually added to
your path to add your own aliae binary to and immediately see the changes appear in your shell.

```bash
go build -o $GOPATH/bin/aliae
```

## Up Next

With everything set up, you're ready to start making changes and create your first [PR][gh-pr]!
