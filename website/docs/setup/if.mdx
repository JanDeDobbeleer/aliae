## Description

The `if` field is a stripped down go [template][templates] conditional statement that
is evaluated with the current environment as the context. If the template statement
evaluates to true, the element is added to the shell.

If `If` field can be either a single string, or a list of strings. Allowing you to have multiple `Ifs` evaluated.
